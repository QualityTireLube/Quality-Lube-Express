The "Home" link has been successfully added to your navigation menu and deployed to your server.

### Navigation Menu
**Home** link added as the **first item** in the navigation menu.

### Current Navigation Order
1. **Home** ← NEW! ✅
2. Services
3. Tires
4. State Inspections

### Technical Details
- **Link:** `href="/"`
- **Position:** First item in navigation
- **Path Type:** Absolute (works from any page)
- **Files Updated:** 39 HTML files

## How It Works

The Home link uses an absolute path (`href="/"`) so it will always take users to your homepage, regardless of which page they're on:

- From homepage: Click Home → stays on homepage
- From `/brakes/`: Click Home → goes to homepage
- From `/fluids-and-filters/`: Click Home → goes to homepage

## Test Your Live Site

Visit any page on your site and verify:

1. **Homepage:** https://qualitytirelube.com/
   - "Home" appears as first navigation item ✅

2. **Any subpage:** https://qualitytirelube.com/brakes/
   - "Home" appears as first navigation item ✅
   - Click "Home" → returns to homepage ✅

3. **Deep page:** https://qualitytirelube.com/fluids-and-filters/
   - "Home" appears as first navigation item ✅
   - Click "Home" → returns to homepage ✅
